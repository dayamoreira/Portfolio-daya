            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Hello! I'm Dayane, a front-end developer with a fascinating background. Before falling in love with the world of web development, I worked as a child educator, where I honed crucial skills like patience, clear communication, and organization - qualities I now apply to writing code and collaborating in tech teams.</p>
            <p>I'm currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and have dived headfirst into front-end development. My aim is to create web interfaces that not only look good but offer a fluid and intuitive user experience.</p>
            <p>My journey here has been unique: from a child educator to a front-end developer. This path taught me to approach problems creatively, the importance of continuous learning, and how to adapt complex messages for diverse audiences.</p>
            <p>I have a strong foundation in HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, and I am proficient in frameworks such as React and Vue.js, as well as tools like Git for version control. I also have experience with CSS preprocessors like SASS, which allows me to write styles more efficiently and with simplified maintenance.</p>
            <p>If you're looking for a dedicated, detail-oriented professional with a genuine love for design and web development, you've come to the right place. Join me on this digital transformation journey, where I seek to apply my skills to create interfaces that not only meet but exceed user expectations.</p>
